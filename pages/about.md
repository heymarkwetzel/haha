Mark is a hot dog. -my cousin Ashley, ~1988

Hi, I'm Mark. And I am a hot dog.

I grew up surrounded by lots of delicious hot dogs. From Pete’s and Gus’s to cocktail weenies, white hots, and more. I just like them.

I also really love penpalling and fell in love with postcards, especially the off-kilter ones, while getting acquainted with the magic of Uncle Fun’s toy store years ago.

One thing led to another and now sometimes I get an idea and I’ve got to start doodling. Sometimes those doodles make me laugh so they turn into postcards. Maybe some things I think are funny other people will think are funny too! And it just feels good to share a laugh.

I have personally confirmed that people as young as 3 and as old as 99 do get a kick out of these cards. And that the Krampus one scares my mom.

There’s sure to be more Haha Hot Dogs stuff coming down the line and the best way to see what it is would be my Instagram. If you’re looking for anything specific or have a reason to get in touch - I’d love to hear from you!

Thanks for stopping by! I hope you’re having a really nice day.

Haha,
Mark
